This software depends on you having a running webserver with python 2.7 installed.

To install, simply copy the files to your web directory.

On IIS, you must add python to your CGI settings

On linux/Apache, the following will work (depending on how your apache install is configured):
cd <web root directory>/cgi-bin
git clone https://github.com/thaynewalker/recipes.git recipes
chown -R apache:apache recipes
ln -s <web root directory>/cgi-bin/recipes <web root directory>/html/recipes

After installing the files, make sure that your recipes.json is writable by the webserver. This can be done on windows by turning off the "read only" setting. On linux run: chmod o+w recipes.json; chmod o+x recipedb.py

Finally open your browser to: http://localhost/recipes/
